# Walkthrough - Video Tracker Enhancements

I have implemented section parsing, progress tracking, and a new "Divine" UI theme.

## Changes

### 1. Section Parsing
- **New Module**: [fetcher.py](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/fetcher.py) handles YouTube data fetching and regex parsing of timestamps from descriptions.
- **Admin Tool**: [manage.py](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/manage.py) now extracts sections when adding a book and includes a "Refresh Sections" option for existing books.

### 2. Progress Tracking
- **Backend**: [app.py](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/simple_calc/app.py) now has an `/api/progress` endpoint to update chapter completion status and calculate total book progress.
- **Frontend**: [book.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/templates/book.html) sends progress updates when chapters are marked as complete.

### 3. UI Refinement ("Divine" Theme)
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Applied a dark, premium theme with gradients, glassmorphism effects, and the "Outfit" font.
- **Visual Indicators**: Added progress bars to the library view and chapter list.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- [test_parsing.py](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/test_parsing.py) passed, confirming that timestamps are correctly extracted from various description formats.

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Add a Book**:
   - Run [run_admin.bat](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/run_admin.bat).
   - Select "Add Book" and paste a YouTube playlist URL (e.g., a Python tutorial).
   - Observe the console output indicating that sections are being parsed.

2. **Check Library**:
   - Run [run_player.bat](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/run_player.bat) (starts the Flask app).
   - Open `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
   - Verify the "Divine" dark theme and the book card.

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Click on the book.
   - Expand a chapter to see the sections (timestamps).
   - Click a timestamp to jump to that part of the video.
   - Check the "Mark as complete" box for a chapter.
   - Go back to the library and verify the progress bar has updated.

## Next Steps
- **Sync**: Implement a way to sync new videos from a playlist.
- **Remove Book**: Implement the "Remove Book" feature in [manage.py](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/Video%20Tracker/manage.py).
